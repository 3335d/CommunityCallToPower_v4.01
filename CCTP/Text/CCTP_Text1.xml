        Great Artists, Engineers, Merchants and Scientists are created in cities by specialists and Wonders which generate "Great People" (GP)  points. A city may generate no Great People points, or it may generate a single kind of GP points or it may generate multiple kinds of GP points. Each city's GP points are kept track of separately. (For example, Kyoto might generate 1 Artist and 2 Engineer GP pts each turn. After 3 turns it would have 3 Artist points and 6 Engineer GP pts. The two types of points are not pooled.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When a city has enough of a specific type of GP points, the points are expended to generate a Great Person of that type. Once a Great Person is generated, the amount required for the next Great Person increases in all of that player's cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For instance, let's say that a player needs to acquire 10 GP pts to get a Great Person. From the previous example, in five turns Kyoto would have enough Engineer GP pts. to create a Great Engineer. After the Great Engineer was created, Kyoto would have 0 Great Engineer points and 5 Great Artist points left, and the amount required for the next Great Person would increase to say 15 points. Eight turns later Kyoto would have 13 Great Artist points and 16 Great Engineer points, and it would generate another Great Engineer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that a Garden building increases the rate at which you generate Great People, and that the "Warrior Code" social policy immediately generates a Great General.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Additionally, once you advance into the Industrial Age, you will be able to expend unused Faith to purchase Great People, depending on what Social Policy branches you have open.

			<Text>There are nine types of Great People: Great Artists, Great Musicians, Great Writers, Great Engineers, Great Merchants, Great Scientists, Great Generals, Great Admirals, and Great Prophets. The first six types are quite similar in functionality, each having abilities related to their areas of expertise, while Great Generals, Great Admirals, and Great Prophets are rather different: they are generated differently and they have different effects upon play. Great Generals and Great Admirals provide bonuses related to land and naval combat, and Great Prophets allow you to found a religion.</Text>

			<Text>The solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy power plant for generating electricity from solar power. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture. As a solar chimney power plant (SCPP) proposal for electrical power generation, commercial investment is discouraged by the high initial cost of building a very large novel structure, and by the risk of investment in a feasible but unproven application of even proven component technology for long-term returns on investment—especially when compared to the proven and demonstrated greater short-term returns on lesser investment in coal-fired or nuclear power plants. Likewise, the benefits of 'clean' or solar power technologies are shared, and the widely shared harmful pollution of existing power generation technologies is not applied as a cost for private commercial investment. This is a well-described economic trade-off between private benefit and shared cost, versus shared benefit and private cost. If it is in the public interest, then some form of public investment or subsidy to share cost and risk will be required to demonstrate SCPP feasibility at scale..</Text>

			<Text>A wind turbine is a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind, also called wind energy, into mechanical energy in a process known as wind power. If the mechanical energy is used to produce electricity, the device may be called a wind turbine or wind power plant. If the mechanical energy is used to drive machinery, such as for grinding grain or pumping water, the device is called a windmill or wind pump. Similarly, it may be referred to as a wind charger when used for charging batteries. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging or auxiliary power on boats; while large grid-connected arrays of turbines are becoming an increasingly important source of wind power-produced commercial electricity.</Text>

				A lumberjack is a worker in the logging industry who performs the initial harvesting and transport of trees for ultimate processing into forest products. The term usually refers to a bygone era (before 1945 in the United States) when hand tools were used in harvesting trees. Because of its historical ties, the term lumberjack has become ingrained in popular culture through folklore, mass media and spectator sports. The actual work was difficult, dangerous, intermittent, low-paying, and primitive in living conditions, but the men built a traditional culture that celebrated strength, masculinity, confrontation with danger, and resistance to modernization.

			<Text>A dungeon is a room or cell in which prisoners are held, especially underground.[NEWLINE]Dungeons are generally associated with medieval castles, though their association with torture probably belongs more to the Renaissance period.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]An oubliette is a form of dungeon which is accessible only from a hatch in a high ceiling.The word dungeon comes from Old French donjon (also spelt dongeon), which in its earliest usage meant a keep, the main tower of a castle. The first recorded instance of the word in English near the beginning of the 14th century also meant "an underground prison cell beneath the castle keep". While some sources cite Medieval Latin dom(i)niōn- "property" (and ultimately dominus "lord") as the original source, it is more likely that the word derives from the Frankish *dungjo, *dungjon- ("dungeon, vault, bower"), from Proto-Germanic *dungijōn, *dungō ("an enclosed space, treasury, vault"), from Proto-Indo-European *dʰengʰ- ("to cover, hide, conceal"),[1] related to Old Saxon dung ("underground vault, cellar"), Old High German tung ("a cellar, underground living quarter"), Old English dung ("a dungeon, prison"), and Old Norse dyngja ("a detached apartment, lady's bower"). In English, a dungeon now usually only signifies the sense of underground prison or oubliette, typically in a basement of a castle, whereas the alternate spelling donjon is generally reserved for the original meaning.</Text>

			<Text>The Inquisition was a group of institutions within the judicial system of the Roman Catholic Church whose aim was to combat heresy. It started in 12th-century France to combat the spread of religious sectarianism, in particular the Cathars and the Waldensians. This Medieval Inquisition persisted into the 14th century, from the 1250s associated with the Dominican Order. In the early 14th century, two other movements attracted the attention of the Inquisition, the Knights Templar and the Beguines. At the end of the Middle Ages, the concept and scope of the Inquisition was significantly expanded, now in the historical context of the turmoils of the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Its geographic scope was expanded to other European countries, as well as throughout the Spanish and Portuguese empires in the Americas, Asia and Africa. Its focus now came to include the persecution of sorcery (an aspect almost entirely absent from the Medieval Inquisition), making it one of the agents in the Early Modern witch-hunts.</Text>

The dam has 32 main generators, each with an individual output of 700 mW, combining with other smaller generators for a combined total output of 22,500 mW, an ammount which would be able to power 6,750,000 homes every hour.

			<Text>Carnival is a festive season which occurs immediately before Lent; the main events are usually during February. Carnival typically involves a public celebration or parade combining some elements of a circus, mask and public street party. People often dress up or masquerade during the celebrations, which mark an overturning of daily life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Carnival is a festival traditionally held in Roman Catholic and, to a lesser extent, Eastern Orthodox societies. Protestant areas usually do not have carnival celebrations or have modified traditions, such as the Danish Carnival or other Shrove Tuesday events. The Brazilian Carnaval is one of the best-known celebrations today, but many cities and regions worldwide celebrate with large, popular, and days-long events. The Carnival of Rio de Janeiro is the biggest carnival in the world, and the biggest popular party on the planet, according The Guinness Book of World Records 2010. The Rio de Janeiro Carnival is also considered the world's most famous.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While it forms an integral part of the Christian calendar, particularly in Catholic regions, some carnival traditions may date back to pre-Christian times. The ancient Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Bacchanalia may possibly have been absorbed into the Italian Carnival. The Saturnalia, in turn, may be based on the Greek Dionysia and Oriental festivals. While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned celebrations, carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Many local carnival customs are based on local pre-Christian rituals, for example the elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian-Alemannic carnival.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some of the best-known traditions, including carnival parades and "masquerade ball" masquerading, were first recorded in medieval Italy. The carnival of Venice was for a long time the most famous carnival. From Italy, carnival traditions spread to the Catholic nations of Spain, Portugal, and France. From France, they spread to the Rhineland of Germany, and to New France in North America. From Spain and Portugal, they spread with Catholic colonization to the Caribbean and Latin America.</Text>

It differs from a regular tower in that its primary use is military, and from a turret in that it is usually a freestanding structure. Its main purpose is to provide a high, safe place from which a sentinel or guard may observe the surrounding area. In some cases, non-military towers, such as religious pagodas, may also be used as watchtowers. An example of nonmilitary watchtower in history is the one of Jerusalem. Though the Hebrews used it to keep a watch for approaching armies, the religious authorities forbade the taking of weapons up into the tower as this would require bringing weapons through the temple. Rebuilt by King Herod, that watchtower was renamed after Mark Antony, his friend who battled against Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (later Augustus) and lost.</Text>

			<Text>Nuclear reprocessing technology was developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel. Reprocessing serves multiple purposes, whose relative importance has changed over time. Originally reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing nuclear weapons. With the commercialization of nuclear power, the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into MOX nuclear fuel for thermal reactors. The reprocessed uranium, which constitutes the bulk of the spent fuel material, can in principle also be re-used as fuel, but that is only economic when uranium prices are high. Finally, a breeder reactor is not restricted to using recycled plutonium and uranium. It can employ all the actinides, closing the nuclear fuel cycle and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from natural uranium by about 60 times. Nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste, but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle.</Text>

A fire department may also provide "fire protection" or fire prevention services, whereby firefighters visit homes and give fire safety advice and fit smoke alarms for members of the public. In many countries fire protection or prevention is seen as an important role for the fire service, as preventing a fire from occurring in the first place can obviously save lives. Most public or municipal fire departments also carry out an enforcement role, to ensure that commercial dwellings (hotels, offices, factories, and so on) are equipped with adequate fire precautions to ensure that in the event of fire, people can safely evacuate the premises unharmed.

			<Text>The term inland port is also used in a narrow sense in the field of transportation systems to mean a rather more specialized facility that has come about with the advent of the intermodal container (standardized shipping container) in international transport. Rather than goods being loaded and unloaded in such ports, shipping containers can just be transferred between ship and road vehicle or ship and train. The container may be transferred again between road and rail elsewhere and the goods are only loaded or unloaded at their point of origin or final destination. Shipping containers allow some functions traditionally carried out at a seaport to be moved elsewhere. Examples are the functions of receiving, processing through customs, inspecting, sorting, and consolidating containers going to the same overseas port. Container transfer at the seaport can be sped up and container handling space can be reduced by transferring functions to an inland site away from the port and coast. Distribution may also be made more efficient by setting up the link between inland site and seaport as, say, a high-capacity rail link with a lower unit cost than sending containers individually by road. The containers are still collected from their origins or distributed to their ultimate destinations by road with the transfer happening at the inland site. An Inland Port is just such an inland site linked to a seaport. This kind of inland port does not require a waterway. Key features of an Inland Port are the transfer of containers between different modes of transportation (intermodal transfer) and the processing of international trade. This differentiates an inland port from a container depot or transport hub. The term inland port may also be used for a similar model of a site linked to an airport or land border crossing rather than a seaport. The definition of inland port in the jargon of the transportation and logistics industries is: "An Inland Port is a physical site located away from traditional land, air and coastal borders with the vision to facilitate and process international trade through strategic investment in multi-modal transportation assets and by promoting value-added services as goods move through the supply chain". — Center for Transportation Research, University of Texas. Inland Ports may also be referred to as dry ports or intermodal hubs.</Text>

Given the differences in climate and crops around the world, harvest festivals can be found at various times at different places. Harvests festivals typically feature feasting, both family and public, with foods that are drawn from crops that come to maturity around the time of the festival. Ample food and freedom from the necessity to work in the fields are two central features of harvest festivals: eating, merriment, contests, music and romance are common features of harvest festivals around the world.</Text>

			<Text>The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer) was a barrier constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) starting on 13 August 1961, that completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin.The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the "death strip") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, "fakir beds" and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc claimed that the wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the people" in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that marked Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period. The Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the "Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart" (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall) by GDR authorities, implying that neighbouring West Germany had not been fully de-Nazified. The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the "Wall of Shame"—a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt—while condemning the Wall's restriction on freedom of movement. Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border (IGB) that demarcated the border between East and West Germany, both borders came to symbolize the "Iron Curtain" that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Before the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin, from where they could then travel to West Germany and other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the wall prevented almost all such emigration. During this period, around 5,000 people attempted to escape over the wall, with an estimated death toll of over 600. In 1989, a series of radical political changes occurred in the Eastern Bloc, associated with the liberalization of the Eastern Bloc's authoritarian systems and the erosion of political power in the pro-Soviet governments in nearby Poland and Hungary. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, a euphoric public and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the wall; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of the rest. The physical Wall itself was primarily destroyed in 1990. The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for German reunification, which was formally concluded on 3 October 1990.</Text>

The Potala Palace was the chief residence of the Dalai Lama until the 14th Dalai Lama fled to Dharamsala, India, after an invasion and failed uprising in 1959.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first palace was built in 637 by the Tibetan king, Songtsen Gampo, as a present for his bride Princess Wen Cheng of the Tang Dynasty of China. The site was previously used by the king as a meditation retreat. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started the construction of the modern Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel, pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today, the Potala Palace is a museum. The building measures 400 metres east-west and 350 metres north-south, with sloping stone walls averaging 3 m. thick, and 5 m. (more than 16 ft) thick at the base, and with copper poured into the foundations to help proof it against earthquakes. Thirteen stories of buildings – containing over 1,000 rooms, 10,000 shrines and about 200,000 statues – soar 117 metres (384 ft) on top of Marpo Ri, the "Red Hill", rising more than 300 m (about 1,000 ft) in total above the valley floor.</Text>

			<Text>Mount Rushmore is the common name for a mountain in the Black Hills of South Dakota, United States of America. It features the faces of four American presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln) carved into the side of the hill, each being approximately 18 metres high. In total, the memorial covers 5.12 square kilometres of space, and was constructed between 1927 and 1941, when a lack of funding casued work to stop. Originally, it had been planned for the upper bodies of all four men to be included as well. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The site chosen was very controversial, as it had previously been granted by the United States government to the people of the Lakota tribe, commonly refered to as the Sioux. It was then seized back less than ten years later following 'The Great Sioux War. In 1971 a group of Native American protestors occupied the mountain, renaming it 'Mount Crazy Horse' after one of their greatest warlord heroes. They have since been appeased by the formation of a Crazy Horse memorial elsewhere in the Black Hills which is intended to be larger than Mount Rushmore. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The mountain itself has also been a center of many conspiricy theories, from lost cities of gold to White Supremacy theories involving Manifest Destiny, stretching even to the White Supremist group the Ku Klux Klan.</Text>

The main hub for tourism to the mountain is the nearby Swiss town of Zermatt, which features a Matterhorn museum. From here, several trains and cable cars operate to gain better views of the mountain. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The first ascent of the Matterhorn marked the end to a golden age of mountaineering in Europe. It was first climbed on June 14, 1865, by an English party of 7 climbers. Upon the decent, however, four fell to their deaths, one of whom has never been found. For years, the Matterhorn instilled fear into climbers which tried to climb it, and several parties that attempted it in the 1850s had no choice but to turn back.</Text>

			<Text>The Pink and White Terraces were one of the larger but breathtaking natural formations in New Zealand. They were found near Rotorua in the North Island of New Zealand. They covered an amazing three hectares and descended down about thirty metres. The Terraces had silica deposits that formed enclosing pools of geothermally heated water. The heated pools were where people used to come from far and wide just to bathe in these extraordinary pools. The Terraces were fed by the steaming multi-coloured waters of the Aulm Lakes that in turn had been created by spectacular geysers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A parade of people came by all sorts of transport - schooner, stagecoach, whaleboat and canoe to visit these naturally formed pools. From the flanks of Mount Tarawera, the magma below the ground slowly formed these extraordinary glistening terraces in blue, pink and white. That is how they got their name. Lauded as "the eighth wonder of the world", at night they looked magical how they were cascading down in the sparkling moonlight.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On June 10th 1886, Mount Tarawera had a violent volcanic eruption, firing out rocks, ash and boiling hot mud for a terrifying four hours or more. The eruption could be seen from as far away as Auckland. After a terrifying night, the villages around Mount Tarawera were buried under ash and lava, but the eruption had also destroyed the Pink and White Terraces.</Text>

			<Text>Folklore (or lore) consists of legends, music, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, fairy tales, stories, tall tales, and customs that are the traditions of a culture, subculture, or group. It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of folklore is sometimes called folkloristics, and people who study folklore are sometimes referred to as "folklorists". The word "folklore" was first used by the Irish antiquarian Liam Murphy in a letter published in the Tipperary journal The Athenaeum in 1846. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology. Stith Thompson made a major attempt to index the motifs of both folklore and mythology, providing an outline into which new motifs can be placed, and scholars can keep track of all older motifs. Folklore can be divided into four areas of study: artifact (such as voodoo dolls), describable and transmissible entity (oral tradition), culture, and behavior (rituals). These areas do not stand alone, however, as often a particular item or element may fit into more than one of these areas.</Text>

An inn is a tavern which has a license to put up guests as lodgers. The word derives from the Latin taberna whose original meaning was a shed or workshop. In the English language, a tavern was once an establishment which served wine whilst an inn served beer and ale. Over time, the words "tavern" and "inn" became interchangeable and synonymous. In England, inns started to be referred to as public houses or pubs and the term became standard for all drinking houses.</Text>

			<Text>The Metéora ("suspended rocks", "suspended in the air" or "in the heavens above" in Greek) is one of the largest and most important complexes of Eastern Orthodox monasteries in Greece, second only to Mount Athos. The six monasteries are built on natural sandstone rock pillars, at the northwestern edge of the Plain of Thessaly near the Pineios river and Pindus Mountains, in central Greece.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The exact date of the establishment of the monasteries is unknown. By the late 11th and early 12th century, a rudimentary monastic state had formed called the Skete of Stagoi and was centered around the still-standing church of Theotokos (mother of God). By the end of the 12th century, an ascetic community had flocked to Metéora. Beginning in the 14th century, more than 20 monasteries were built. Six remain today.</Text>

			<Text>The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is an international humanitarian movement with approximately 97 million volunteers, members and staff worldwide which was founded to protect human life and health, to ensure respect for all human beings, and to prevent and alleviate human suffering, without any discrimination based on nationality, race, sex, religious beliefs, class or political opinions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The movement consists of several distinct organizations that are legally independent from each other, but are united within the movement through common basic principles, objectives, symbols, statutes and governing organs. The pioneering organization was the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a private humanitarian institution founded in 1863 in Geneva, Switzerland, by Henry Dunant. Its 25-member committee has a unique authority under international humanitarian law to protect the life and dignity of the victims of international and internal armed conflicts. The ICRC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on three occasions: in 1917, 1944 and 1963.</Text>

The hill was formerly the site of a monastery, which was constructed following a rumoured appiration of the Virgin Mary. This monastery was destroyed in the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755. Remaining untouched for many years, it was in 1838 that, after being purchased by King consort Ferdinand II, the grounds of the original monastery were rebuilt into a palace for the Portuguese royal family to stay at during the summer.  The building of this new palace was placed under command of a notable German architect and engineer, Baron Wilhelm Ludwig von Eschwege, and construction was completed in 1854.  It remained in possession of the Portuguese royal family until the Republican Revolution of 1910, after which it was turned into a national monument as well as a museum.  Finally, in 1995 the palace was turned into a world heritage site by UNESCO.</Text>

It served as the capital of the Saudeleur dynasty of the island from approximately the 12th century CE until 1628, when the site was abandoned. It is often refered to as the 'Venice of the Pacific', after the fact that the city was built on the shoreline and out to sea and features a series of canals throughout the site. Local legends say that Nan Madol was constructed by Olisihpa and Olosohpa, twin sorcerers who wished to worship the god of Agriculture, Nahnisohn Sahpw, and constructed an altar at the future site of the city. This lead to the sacred nature of most of the city, and the reason for the location of its construction. Food and Water were brought in by boat for the Saudeleur populace, which allowed for the continuation of the city. When this was interrupted by the invading Nahnmwarkis, who subsequently occupied the city following 1628, they were unable to sustain the city and eventually abandoned it.</Text>

			<Text>The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code, dating back to about 1772 BC. It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a human-sized stone stele and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" (lex talionis) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man.The Code of Hammurabi was one of several sets of laws in the ancient Near East.[7] The code of laws was arranged in orderly groups, so that everyone who read the laws would know what was required of them.[8] Earlier collections of laws include the Code of Ur-Nammu, king of Ur (ca. 2050 BC), the Laws of Eshnunna (ca. 1930 BC) and the codex of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (ca. 1870 BC), while later ones include the Hittite laws, the Assyrian laws, and Mosaic Law. These codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other. The Code of Hammurabi is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period.[11] The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental law regulating a government — i.e., a primitive constitution.

It was constructed under the orders of Mehmed II "The Conqueror", under whom the city was captured from the Byzantines and renamed Istanbul, as part of a scheme to re-build the city following the sucessful Ottoman siege. The palace served as the official residence of the Ottoman sultans for nearly four centuries of their rule, lasting until Sultan Abdul Mecid I moved the court to a newly-built palace further up the Bosphorous in 1856. Topkapi Palace is in fact more of a walled village than a palace, with several small buildings and many courtyards as opposed to one central structure. The site is home to many relics and artefacts collected both by the Sultans and following the end of the Ottoman empire when the palace was turned into a Museum. Among these are relics sacred to the Islamic world, including a door to the Great Mosque of Mecca, as well as what is said to be the cloak and sword of the prophet Muhammed. Other items include many collected from Silk Road trade, such as various pieces of Chinese porcelain from across four different dynasties of rule, and a collection of Islamic weaponry spanning approximately 13 centuries. Although the palace is largely still intact, some parts have since been lost as a result of either Earthquakes or fire.</Text>

It was surpassed by the construction of the World Trade Center towers, but is now the tallest again following the events of September 11, 2001. Upon construction of the 443 metre tall building, the top was originally hoped to be an Airship terminal for New York City, transporting passengers to the ground via two elevators. This, however, was deemed to risky due to updrafts caused by the size of the building. Along with the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building is a prime example of Art Deco architecture which was prominent during the Depression years of 1929-1932, and continued into World War 2.

			<Text>Buda Castle is a complex of fortifications and the residence to the Hungarian kings in Budapest. Castle Hill - site of Buda Castle - was first occupied in 1265 by King Béla IV. The oldest part of the complex is the foundations of Stephen's Tower, a caster keep built during the fourteenth century by Stephen, the Duke of Slovakia and younger brother to King Louis I of Hungary. King Sigismund strengthened its fortifications and enlarged the palace, from 1410 until after his death in 1437, as a bid to express primacy among Europe as the Holy Roman Emperor. Kings Matthias Corvinus, Vladislaus II and John Zápolya all continued the work of the expansion of the castle before the Ottomans conquered Budapest and the castle, and the subsequent sieges contributed to the medieval castle's ruin, especially during the Battle of Buda in 1686. Work on the castle was on and off for many years until in 1748 Count Antal Grassalkovich appealed to the public to complete the repairs of the castle. The Palatine János Pálffy appealed to the countries and city-states to award grants; the moment was most opportune as support for the Habsburgs were at its peak and Hungarians supported Maria Theresa in the War of Austrian Succession. The queen was appreciative and funded the work to reconstruct Buda Castle. Since then the castle has gone through many cycles of destruction and rebuilding right up to the end of World War II, where in 1948 the re-construction of the castle took on a modernist design. The current version of the castle was build in 1966 and the interior completed in the 1980s.</Text>

The term tree of life may also be used as a synonym for 'sacred tree'.[NEWLINE](Quoted from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life)</Text>

			<Text>Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'Green table') is the name given to a large area of what is now part of the American state of Colorado but was once a large settlement of the Pueblo (Anasazi) civilization of Native Americans. The area is believed to have been first settled c.400 CE, reaching its peak around the 12th-13th centuries before declining in the 1200's as a result of climate change and an increased population. One of the most iconic sites of Mesa Verde is the cliff palace, a large arrangement of buildings constructed under a rocky outcrop at the site which is believed to have been brightly painted during the peak of the Pueblo culture. Other than the cliff palace there are several more major Pueblo constructions within the area, including defensive towers and reservoirs, indicating that this site was once a thriving settlement.  </Text>

			<Text>El Tajín is one of the largest and most important pre-Colombian cities in Classical Mesoamerica. From as far back as at least 5600 BC, nomadic hunters and gatherers became farmers to create the complex societies of a civilization. While the city's rise in both prominence and progression hastened during the rise of the Olmec, c. 1150 BC, it is still not entirely clear who did build the city, though mounting evidence suggests the Huastec culture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Monumental construction began at about the first century CE, and from this by 600 El Tajín was a city. The city's position over the Mesoamerican trade routes is largely due to its rise; the city was able to control the flow of the import and export of commodites. One of its major trade partners of its time was Teotihuacan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most noted feature of the site is the Pyramid of Niches. This structure has seven stories, each of which consist of a sloping base and a vertical wall. These features are common in Mesoamerican architecture, but the pyramid also contains uncommon designs, mainly decorative niches. The original design of this pyramid was ritual; the niches imitate caves, these were considered to be underground passages to the underworld, where a number of the gods lived.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El Tajín lasted up to the thirteenth century when it caught on fire, it is assumed that the invading Chichimecas at the time are to blame. The jungle took over the site and it rested dormant for more than half a millenium, until 1785; a chance discovery by Diego Ruiz stumbled upon the Pyramid of Niches. At the time Ruiz was searching for clandestine tobacco plantations that breached the royal monopoly.</Text>

It was first observed during the 1960's, when archeologists noted that the hill could not be natural due to the shape, yet dismissed it as a Byzantine burial ground. It was not thought different until 1994, and not excavated until a year later. The complex is similar in manner to Stonehenge, with a round shape and large Monolithic stones.

			<Text>The Tower of Babel, according to the Book of Genesis, was an enormous tower built in the plain of Shinar. A united humanity of the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating from the east, came to the land of Shinar, where they resolved to build a city with a tower "with its top in the heavens". According to the biblical account, God came down to see what they did and said: "They are one people and have one language, and nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do." So God said, "Come, let us go down and confound their speech." And so God scattered them upon the face of the Earth, and confused their languages, and they left off building the city, which was called Babel "because God there confounded the language of all the Earth". [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Tower of Babel has often been associated with known structures, notably the Etemenanki, a ziggurat dedicated to Marduk by Nabopolassar (c. 610 BC). According to modern scholars, the biblical story of the Tower of Babel was likely influenced by Etemenanki during the Babylonian captivity of the Hebrews. The Greek historian Herodotus (440 BC) later wrote of this ziggurat, which he called the "Temple of Zeus Belus", giving an account of its vast dimensions. The already decayed Great Ziggurat of Babylon was finally destroyed by Alexander the Great in an attempt to rebuild it. He managed to move the tiles of the tower to another location, but his death stopped the reconstruction.</Text>

It consists of the dish, which is on the ground, and a large reciever suspended above the dish by three towers which vary in height due to ground elevation. Since its construction in 1963, the observatory has been used for a variety of different purposes. Originally designed to study Earth's Ionosphere (The layer of Earth's atmosphere above 85 kilometres where solar radiation still affects the atmosphere. Auroras form in this layer), the Arecibo Observatory has since made a variety of discoveries and been used for several research projects. In 1990, the telescope was used to discover the first ever known Exo-planets (Planets existing outside our own Solar System). It was also used to discover Neutron stars (stars that half half a million times more mass than Earth in an area equivalent to the size of Brooklyn, New York). It has also been used for countless other astronomical discoveries. In 1974, the Observatory sent a message of binary characters, consisting of the numbers 1 to 10, DNA makeup, the solar system and more information, towards a star cluster known as globular cluser M13, around 25,000 light years away, in the hope of contacting intelligent life. </Text>

The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC, as a lasting monument to himself and his queen Nefertari, to commemorate his alleged victory at the Battle of Kadesh, and to intimidate his Nubian neighbors. However, the complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir. The relocation of the temples was necessary to avoid their being submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile River.

It has been named one of the seven modern wonders of the world by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The canal had an enormous impact on shipping between the two oceans, replacing the long and treacherous route via either the Strait of Magellan or Cape Horn at the southernmost tip of South America. A ship sailing from New York to San Francisco via the canal travels 9,500 km, well under half the 22,500 km route around Cape Horn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The concept of a canal near Panama dates to the early 16th century. The first attempt to construct a canal began in 1880 under French leadership, but was abandoned after 21,900 workers died, largely from disease, particularly malaria and yellow fever, and landslides. The United States launched a second effort, incurring a further 5,600 deaths but succeeding in opening the canal in 1914. The U.S. controlled the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it until the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for the transition of control to Panama. From 1979 to 1999 the canal was under joint U.S.–Panamanian administration, and from 31 December 1999 command of the waterway was assumed by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government.</Text>

It was dedicated to two gods of the Aztec pantheon, Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, and Tlaloc, the god of rain and agriculture. The dedication to two gods was the reason for the temple having twin shrines and staircases, each one dedicated to a seperate god. It is widely believed that the Shrine of Tlaloc was painted blue, while Huitzilopochtli's shrine was red. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The exact date of the first construction is not known, although most estimates put this to be sometime in the early 14th century. Each sucessive generation of Aztec citizens increased the size of Templo Mayor by building around the previous building. This is believed to have happened about six times across the life of the temple. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs by Hernan Cortez in 1521, Templo Mayor was destroyed, along with the rest of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish filled in the lake upon which the city was built, and covered the site in soil. They then built the modern day city of Mexico on the site. </Text>

Similar totem-like beliefs have been historically present in societies throughout much of the world, including Africa, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and the Arctic polar region.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Totemism is a religious belief that is frequently associated with shamanistic religions. The totem is usually an animal or other natural figure that spiritually represents a group of related people such as a clan. The mis-named totem poles of the Pacific Northwest of North America are, in fact, not totemic in nature, rather they are heraldic in nature.

In 1863, the Sultan of Oman moved his capital to Zanzibar, and created a lush palace complex on the island in Stone Town, and spurred the island and Stone Town into a period of rapid development. A war of sucession following the reign of one of the sultans caused Zanzibar to become an independant sultanate from Oman, leading to more development of Stone Town.  </Text>

It was constructed in 1431 in memory of a Muslim merchant known as Sayyed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari (R.A.), who prior to settling in Mumbai, travelled through Persia and modern day Uzbekistan. After accumulating great wealth he gave up all his worldly possessions and embarked on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Upon this trip he died, and his body is said to have floated back to India, and became stuck on the islet which formed the site of his tomb. The Dargah is linked to the coast with a causeway which becomes flooded at high tide, and as such it is only accessiable at low tide. Even with this limited accessibility, on average 80,000 people a week visit the site, often to recieve a blessing. The Indo-Islamic architecture is often worn down by salt spray, and as such in 2008 the site was extensively refurbished. </Text>

To finance the colossal project, a number of popes authorized the wholesale selling of indulgences, a practice that led in part to Martin Luther's protestant movement.

It is world renowned for it's iconic "Floating" torii gate, which pilgrims had to steer their boat through before they could enter the shrine's grounds. It is located on the island of Itsukushima, at the western end of Japan's 'inland sea'. There has been a shrine at the location since approximately 628 CE, when one was constructed under the reign of Empresss Suiko. The current design, however, dates from 1168, when the shrine was constructed with funds provided by the warlord Taiya no Kiyomori. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The shrine, and it's floating Torii, are one of the 'Three Views of Japan', along with the sandbar at Amanohashidate, and Matsushima bay.

			<Text>The Gate of the Sun is a megalithic stone gateway constructed by the Tiwanaku, one of the most important precursor cultures to the Inca Empire. The structure stands beside Lake Titicaca, near the Bolivian city of La Paz. Ten feet tall and thirteen feet wide, the gate is a single stone block weighing an estimated ten tons. Rediscovered by Europeans in the mid-nineteenth century, the gate was found lying on the ground with a large crack across its face. Even though the gate now sits on the site of its discovery, it is not believed to be the site of its construction, which remains uncertain. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gate is a wealth of knowledge of pre-Colombian art and architecture. The gate displays elements of Tiwanaku iconography known to be found throughout Peru and parts of Bolivia. Although there are differing theories of the inscriptions found, they are generally believed to possess astronomical, or perhaps astrological, significance and may have served a calendrical purpose.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Across the head of the gate are 48 squares surrounding a central figure. Each of these squares depict a winged effigy, 32 of which with human faces. All of these effigies look to the central figure, who also remains unknown. The figure is that of a man whose head is surrounded by rays which may represent the rays of the sun. The figure holds two stylized staffs which appear to represent thunder and lightning. Current theories about this character are that he may be the "Sun God", while other identify him as Viracocha, the Incan creator god - who is worshiped as a god of the sun and storms.</Text>

			<Text>The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the opening of the San Francisco Bay into the Pacific Ocean. As part of both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1, it connects the city of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County. The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when it was completed in 1937, and has become one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and of the United States. Despite its span length being surpassed by eight other bridges since its completion, it still has the second longest suspension bridge main span in the United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. It has been declared one of the modern Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Joseph Baermann Strauss, a German-American structural engineer and designer, was the chief engineer in charge of overall design and construction of the bridge project. However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension designs, responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and championed by New York’s Manhattan Bridge designer Leon Moisseiff. Irving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements such as the streetlights, railing, and walkways.</Text>

			<Text>Knossos Palace, also known as Labyrinth, is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and probably the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture. The palace appears as a maze of workrooms, living spaces, and store rooms close to a central square. Detailed images of Cretan life in the late Bronze Age are provided by images on the walls of this palace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Palace is about 130 meters on a side and since the Roman period has been suggested as the source of the myth of the Labyrinth, an elaborate mazelike structure built for King Minos of Crete and designed by the legendary artificer Daedalus to hold the Minotaur, a creature that was half man and half bull and was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Knossos Palace was built gradually between 1700 and 1400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destruction. The 6 acres (24,000 mq) of the palace included a theatre, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces and extensive storerooms, called magazines. They contained large clay vases that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were created at the palace itself, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Palace had at least three separate liquid management systems, one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water. Aqueducts brought fresh water to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and spigots. Due to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had porticoes and air shafts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Palace also includes the Minoan Column, a structure notably different from other Greek columns. Unlike the stone columns characteristic of other Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a cypress tree, common to the Mediterranean. The columns at the Palace of Minos were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like capitals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The centerpiece of the "Minoan" Palace was the so-called Throne Room. This chamber has an alabaster seat built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are gypsum benches. The throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two griffins couchant facing the throne, one on either side. The actual use of the room and the throne is unclear. It is also speculated that the throne was made specifically for a female individual, since the indent seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks.</Text>

			<Text>Te Tii Marae is a unique meeting center. Like other marae in the Pacific, it served as both a sacred place for religion and a social meeting place in Polynesian culture. The term 'marae' - mala'e in Tongan and malae in Samoan and Hawaiian - means 'cleared, free of weeds and trees'. In the Maori society the marae is where the culture flourishes; obligations between tribes are met there, families would hold certain occasions there, and important ceremonies are held there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Te Tii Marae is more than that, however. The site is still in use today as part of Waitangi Day, the New Zealand holiday to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. On February 6 1840 the treaty was signed in a marquee at the grounds of James Busby's house - now known as the Treaty House, making New Zealand part of the British Empire and ensuring the right of the Maori to their land and their rights as British subjects. However this had led to disagreements between the Europeans and Maori. The Maori view the treaty as a sacred pact, while the Pakeha - Maori for European New Zealanders - have taken disregard to it for many years. Chief Justice James Prendergast declared the treaty a 'legal nullity' in 1877, displaying the European disconcern of the treaty until the Treaty of Waitangi Act in 1975 - almost a century later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today Te Tii Marae hosts the annual celebrations the day before Waitangi Day - Feburary 5 - where the New Zealander Prime Minister and other political figures are invited to the site and hears the speeches of the iwi - the large social group of Maori society. With celebration comes tensions between the two peoples as Waidangi Day is also a hotspot for Maori rights; as far back as 1971 Waitangi and the day have been marred by protests and activism concerning the treaty.</Text>

			<Text>Sometimes referred to as the 'Tiger's Nest', Paro Taktsang is a prominent Himalayan Buddhist temple complex resting along the cliff face of the upper Paro Valley in Bhutan. The temple was built in 1692 by Gyalse Tenzin Rebgye, the fourth Druk Desi - secular ruler - of Bhutan. Tenzin Rebgye arrived at the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave - the site where Guru Padmasambhava, an 8th century Buddhist Guru credited for introducing Buddhism to Bhutan, was said to have meditated there from three years, three months, three weeks, three days and three hours.Paro Taktsang is best known for its thirteen taktsang - tiger lair - caves, where Padmasambhava is said to have meditated. Within the complex there is the Gu-ru mTshan-brgyad Lhakhang - "the Temple of the Guru with Eight Names", a temple devoted to the Guru himself. This temple is a cultural icon in Bhutan as well as a symbol of Buddhism in the country. At around March or April the popular Tsechu festival is held in the Paro Valley honouring Padmasambhava.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Legends surrounding the site are plentyful. The most commonly accepted belief is that Padmasambhava flew from Tibet to the Paro Valley on the back of a flying tigress and the site was consecrated to tame the Tiger demon. Another common legend is that a former wife of an emperor, Yeshe Tsogyal, became a disciple of Padmasambhava in Tibet, where she turned herself into a tigress and thus carried the Guru to the valley. From the eleventh century many Tibetan saints came to the site for meditation, some include Milarepa, Machig Labdrön and Thangton Gyelpo. Many of these saints, including all mentioned, established Buddhist monasteries, spreading Buddhism to all parts of the would-be country. On April 19, 1998, a fire broke out in the main building of the complex, containing within valuable paintings and religious artifacts. It is believed the fire was electrical in nature, either a short-circuit or a flickering lamp lighting tapestries. The cost of the fire is estimated at 135 million ngultrum - $US2.5 million today - and sadly the life of a monk. During 2005 both the King and the Government of Bhutan oversaw the restoration of the temple complex and its contents therein.</Text>

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The construction was ordered by a monk at a nearby monastery, who wanted a statue to calm the violent currents of the Min and Dadu rivers, which combine at the base of the statue, to make the area safer for merchants and other watergoing craft. As a result of the construction, the currents were altered and the area became safer for boats.

Attalus I, successor and nephew of Eumenes I, was the first to achieve full independence for the territory and proclaimed himself king after his victory over the Celtic Galatians in 228 BC. His son, Eumenes II, further limited the influence of the Galatians and ruled jointly with his brother Attalos II, who succeeded him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The altar structure is 35.64 meters wide and 33.4 meters deep; the front stairway alone is almost 20 meters wide.

There is a second, smaller and less well preserved high relief frieze on the inner court walls which surround the actual fire altar on the upper level of the structure at the top of the stairs.

Additional facilities are located across the United States and her former holdings, with such establishments being found in Arizona and New York City (among others in American territory) and as far afield as Panama. In addition to this, 168 other museums across the world are Smithsonian affiliates.</Text>

Its Great Buddha Hall displays the world’s largest bronze statue of the Buddha Vairocana and serves as the headquarters of the Kegon school of Buddhism in the country. Sika deer roam the grounds freely; they are regarded as messengers of the gods in Shinto.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The site of the temple was built during 728 by Emperor Shomu as an appeasement for his first son to consort Komyoshi, Prince Motoi, who died a year after his birth. The Tenpyo era followed and caused severe devastation and epidemics. These prompted Shomu to promote the construction of provincial temples across Japan. Known then as Kinshosen-ji, Shomu appointed Todai-ji the Provincial temple of Yamato Province and the head of all the temples. The complex maintained influence in the province and the rest of Japan until Japanese Buddhism moved from Nara to Mount Hiei and the capital of Japan moved to Kamakura during the mid ninth century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The complex features many structures, all to appeal to the aesthetics of the garden designs. Over its history villas next to Todai-ji have become part of the complex, some of these are open to public viewing. Within the complex houses a number of architectural masterpieces; including the Nigatsu-do – the Hall of the Second Month - and the illustrious Daibutsuden – Great Buddha Hall.</Text>

Interestingly, the Dome of the Rock was constructed not as a mosque, but rather as a shrine for Muslim pilgrims venturing to the Holy Land. Below the Dome of the Rock are a series of caverns which run throughout Jerusalem. These can be accessed via a crack in the Foundation Rock which leads to a cave known as the 'Well of Souls', a term made popular by the movie Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. The exterior of the dome is made from porcelain and is octagonal in shape. Predominantly blue in the upper sections, islamic motifs cover the entire section.

			<Text>Horyu-ji is a Buddhist temple located in the Nara Prefecture of Japan. The name translates as Temple of the Flourishing Law, with Ji translating as Temple. The complex was completed in the year 607, at which time it was known as Ikaruga-dera. The temple was comissioned by Prince Shotoku, the palace complex of whom occupied the eastern portion of the grounds. It is widely believed that the current temple is a restoration, after the original temple was destroyed in 670 by what is believed to be fire. Horyu-ji possesses a unique style of architecture, combining elements of Han and Wei Chinese Kingdoms, the Three Kingdoms of Korea and traditional Japanese architecture. The original temple would have lacked this, and as such the restoration allowed for a unique combination of architecture styles seen through exploration of the Eastern Asia region that is extremely unusal, and only seen in other Asuka style buildings in the Nara Prefecture, yet Horyu-ji is unique even amongst these. Other Asuka style complexes feature layouts that are similar to Chinese and Korean counterparts as well as the architecture. Horyu-ji, however, as it is a restoration, is built on the footprints of the earlier temple, and as such shares the layout, which is a Japanese temple style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Horyu-ji has several different iconic buildings, each with features unique to the temple. The Pagoda is one of the oldest wooden buildings on Earth. The central pillar is constructed from a tree dated to being felled in 594 CE. At the base of this pillar is said to be a fragment of a bone of Buddha. The five tiered style of the pagoda means that one is not allowed to climb up. Horyu-ji also features a Kondō, the wood of which dates to 670 CE. This has been suggested as being proof that the building was under construction at the time of the fire that destroyed so much of the rest of the complex. The complex also houses several pieces that are national Japanese treasures, including Buddhist treasures dating to the 7th Century, murals which combine artstyles of Japan and mainland Asia, and are similar to those found in the Ajanta Caves of India. There are also Kannon statuettes and other religious iconography. </Text>

			<Text>The Pont du Gard is a notable ancient Roman aqueduct bridge that crosses the Gard River in southern France. It is part of a 50 km long aqueduct that runs between Uzès and Nîmes in the South of France. It is located in Vers-Pont-du-Gard near Remoulins, in the Gard département. The aqueduct was constructed by the Romans in the 1st century AD and it is the highest of all Roman aqueduct bridges.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The bridge has three rows of arches, standing 48.8 m high, and formerly carried an estimated 200 million litres of water a day to the fountains, baths and homes of the citizens of Nîmes. The aqueduct descends in height by only 17 m over its entire length, indicative of the great precision that Roman engineers were able to achieve using only simple technology. It was possibly used until as late as the 9th century, well after the fall of Rome. However, lack of maintenance after the 4th century meant that it became increasingly clogged by mineral deposits and debris that eventually choked off the flow of water.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Pont du Gard's subsidiary function as a toll bridge ensured its survival in the Middle Ages. Although some of its stones were looted, the local lords and bishops were for centuries responsible for its upkeep in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river. It attracted increasing fame from the 18th century onwards and today it is one of France's most popular tourist attractions.</Text>

			<Text>Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus ("of amber" or "like amber", from ήλεκτρον [elektron], the Greek word for "amber") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words "electric" and "electricity", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646</Text>

				Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though advances in the science were not made until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Practical applications for electricity however remained few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society. Electricity's extraordinary versatility as a means of providing energy means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is the backbone of modern industrial society.

The word "cigar" originated from the word "cigarro" in Spanish, which probably came from the Mayan "sikar" ("to smoke rolled tobacco leaves" – from sik, "tobacco;") or from the Spanish word cigarra ("grasshopper"). However, the word itself, and variations on it, did not come into general use until 1730. New names for cigars include "Jules", "Havana", "Vitole" and "Puro".

Its earliest documented use is around 1100 BC. The majority of the Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as xocolatl, a Nahuatl word meaning "bitter water". The Europeans sweetened and fattened it by adding refined sugar and milk, two ingredients unknown to the Mexicans. By contrast, the Europeans never infused it into their general diet, but have compartmentalized its use to sweets and desserts. In the 19th century, Briton John Cadbury developed an emulsification process to make solid chocolate, creating the modern chocolate bar.

The history of creating glass can be traced back to 3500 BCE in Mesopotamia. The term glass developed in the late Roman Empire. It was in the Roman glassmaking center at Trier, now in modern Germany, that the late-Latin term glesum originated, probably from a Germanic word for a transparent, lustrous substance. The center for luxury glassmaking from the 14th century was the island of Murano, which developed many new techniques and became the center of a lucrative export trade in dinnerware, mirrors, and other items. What made Venetian Murano glass significantly different was that the local quartz pebbles were almost pure silica, and were ground into a fine clear sand that was combined with soda ash obtained from the Levant, for which the Venetians held the sole monopoly.</Text>
